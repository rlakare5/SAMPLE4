Full AI Project Prompt – AgriIntel Website

Create a full AI-powered project named “AgriIntel” — a smart agriculture platform available as a web app.
The goal is to help farmers and vendors make better farming and business decisions through live data, AI predictions, and market analytics.


🌱 1. Farmer Panel

Farmers can register, log in, and add details about their farmland and crops.
	•	The farmer selects or draws their farm area on a map.
	•	The app automatically detects their location using GPS.
	•	The system uses a weather API to predict weather for the next 6 months.
	•	Based on the selected crop and area, the system calculates:
	•	Required number of seeds
	•	Estimated yield
	•	Predicted profit or loss
	•	Farmers also get:
	•	Real-time market value of their crops (based on mandi data)
	•	AI-generated farming insights and tips
	•	Output: A detailed weather + seed + market + profit report shown in a clean and simple dashboard.
	•	Also add mutilanguage support- USING translate api - English, marathi, hindi, etc


💼 2. Vendor / Businessman Panel

Vendors can register as buyers to find and purchase crops directly from farmers.
	•	Vendors can browse available crops uploaded by farmers.
	•	They can view:
	•	Crop type, quantity, location, and harvest time
	•	Live market price and forecasted price of each crop
	•	Contact option to reach the farmer or send inquiries
	•	Vendors can:
	•	Filter crops by region, crop type, or price
	•	Receive alerts for price changes or crop availability
	•	All data comes directly from live mandi APIs and weather APIs, updated automatically.

🧠 3. Admin Panel (AI-Driven)

The admin dashboard is fully AI-powered — no manual input is needed.
	•	Admin can:
	•	View all registered farmers and vendors
	•	Monitor system analytics, weather insights, and market trends
	•	Review and respond to user complaints or feedback
	•	Dashboard sections:
	•	Total farmers and vendors
	•	Real-time weather and market data feeds
	•	Reports and analytics charts
	•	Complaint management table
	•	The admin mainly observes and monitors — the AI handles all data collection, prediction, and analysis.

⚙️ 4. System Features & Technology
	•	Location Detection: GPS-based auto-location using map integration.
	•	Weather Forecast: API to predict 6-month weather data for the selected area.
	•	Market Value: Live mandi and agricultural market APIs for crop prices.
	•	Profit/Loss Analysis: AI model calculates expected outcome based on area, seed cost, and market forecast.
	•	Data Visualization: Real-time charts, reports, and analytics dashboards.
	•	AI Automation: All predictions, analytics, and updates are auto-generated by AI.

⚙️ 5. Teach Stack
	•	PHP, PostgreSQL database

        
🎯 6. Goal

Build a clean, user-friendly, and fully automated system where:
	•	Farmers get crop insights, weather forecasts, and profit analysis.
	•	Vendors get live price updates and direct farmer connections.
	•	Admin monitors system activity through an AI-driven dashboard.

Focus on:
	•	Simplicity
	•	Real-time AI data
	•	Professional UI/UX for farmers and vendors
	•	Efficient integration of APIs and AI predictions


Output Expected:
A complete project blueprint or app structure including:
	•	UI screens for Farmer, Vendor, and Admin panels
	•	Backend logic for weather, market, and profit analysis
	•	Database schema
	•	AI automation flow and real-time data visualization
